INTRODUCTION
PRIVACY POLICY
HOW THE BREEJ HANDLES YOUR DATA EFFECTIVE JANUARY 29, 2022
As part of our mission to promote convenience and flexibility in learning, we collect and use information about you, our:
1. Tutors and Content Creators using The Breej to promote your tutorial services and educational content
2. Users who use The Breej to gain access to tutors and educational content
3. Partners develop apps for tutors and content creators to use, refer potential tutors and content creators to The Breej, or otherwise help tutors and content creators operate and improve their experience on The Breej’s platform
4. Users of other The Breej services
5. Visitors to The Breej’s website or anyone contacting The Breej support.
This privacy policy will help you better understand how we collect, use, and share your personal information. If we change our privacy practices, we may update this privacy policy. If any changes are significant, we will let you know (for example, through The Breej admin or by email)
OUR VALUES
Integrity is the cornerstone of The Breej platform and that includes trusting us to do the right thing with your information. Three main values guide us as we develop our products and services. These values should give you a better understanding of how we think about your information and privacy.
Your information belongs to you
We carefully analyze what types of information we need to provide our services, and we try to limit the information we collect to only what we need. Where possible, we delete or anonymize this information when we no longer need it. When building and improving our products, our engineers work closely with our privacy and security
teams to build with privacy in mind. In all of this work our guiding principle is that your information belongs to you, and our goal is to only use your information to your benefit.
We protect your information from others
If a third party requests for your personal information, we will decline the request unless you give us permission or we are legally required. When we are legally required to share your personal information, we will tell you in advance, unless we are legally forbidden.
We help tutors, content creators and partners meet their privacy obligations
Many of the tutors, content creators and partners using The Breej do not have the benefit of a dedicated privacy team, and it is important to us to help them meet their privacy obligations. To do this, we try to build our products and services so they can be easily used in a privacy-friendly way. We also provide detailed FAQs, documentation and white papers covering the most important privacy-related topics, and respond privacy-related questions we receive.
WHY WE PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION
We generally process your information when we need to do so to fulfil a contractual obligation (for example, to process your payments so as to be able to use The Breej’s services), or where we or someone we work with needs to use your information for a reason related to their business (for example, to provide you with a service). These reasons may be termed as “legitimate interests”. These “legitimate interests” include:
- Preventing risk and fraud
- Answering questions or providing other types of support
- Helping merchants find and use apps through our app store
- Providing reporting and analytics
- Testing features or additional services
- Assisting with marketing, advertising, or other communications
We only process personal information for these “legitimate interests” after considering the potential risks to your privacy – for example, by providing clear transparency into our privacy practices, offering you control over your personal

information where appropriate, limiting the information we keep, limiting what we do with your information, who we send your information to, how long we keep your information, or the technical measures we use to protect your information.
One of the ways in which we may help tutors and content creators using The Breej is by using techniques like “machine learning” to help us improve our services. When we use machine learning, we either: (1) still have a human being involved in the process (and so are not fully automated); or (2) use machine learning in ways that don’t have significant privacy implications (for example, reordering how apps might appear when you visit the app store).
YOUR RIGHTS OVER YOUR INFORMATION
We believe you should be able to access your and control your personal information no matter where you live. Depending on how you use The Breej, you may have the right to request access to, correct, amend, delete, port to another service provider, restrict, or object to certain uses of your personal information (for example, direct marketing). We will not charge you more or provide you with a different level of service if you exercise any of these rights.
If you buy any educational content, or book any session on The Breej and wish to exercise these rights over information about your purchases, you need to directly contact the content creator or tutor you interacted with. We are only a processor on their behalf, and cannot decide how to process their information. We will of course help our content creators and tutors to fulfil these requests by giving them the tools to do so and by answering their questions.
If you are a content creator, tutor, partner, The Breej employee, or other individual that The Breej has a direct relationship with, please submit your data subject request through our online portal. Please note that if you send us a request relating to your personal information, we may have to make sure that that it is you before we can respond. In order to do so, we may use a third party to collect and verify identification documents.
If you are not happy with our response to a request, you can contact us to resolve the issue. You also have the right to contact your local data protection or privacy authority at any time.
WHERE WE SEND YOUR INFORMATION
We are a Nigerian company, but we work with and process data about individuals across the world. To operate our business, we may send your personal information outside of your state, province, or country. This data may be subject to the laws of the

country where we send it. When we send your information across borders, we take steps to protect your information, and we try to only send your information to countries that have strong data protection laws.
Finally, while we do what we can to protect your information, we may at times be legally required to disclose your information (for example, we receive a valid court order).
HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION
Our teams work tirelessly to protect your information, and to ensure the security and integrity of our platform. We also have independent auditors assess the security of our data storage and systems that process financial information. However, we all know that no method of transmission over the internet, and method of electronic storage, can be 100% secure. This means we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your personal information.
